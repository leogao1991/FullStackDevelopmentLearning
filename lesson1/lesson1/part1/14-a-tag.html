      China (Chinese: 中国; pinyin: Zhōngguó), officially the People's Republic
      of China (PRC),[k] is a country in East Asia. It has a population
      exceeding 1.4 billion. China spans the equivalent of five time zones and
      borders fourteen countries by land,[l] the most of any country in the
      world. With an area of approximately 9.6 million square kilometres
      (3,700,000 sq mi), it is the world's third largest country by total land
      area.[m] The country consists of 22 provinces,[n] five autonomous regions,
      four municipalities, and two special administrative regions (Hong Kong and
      Macau). The national capital is Beijing, and the most populous city and
      largest financial center is Shanghai. Modern China traces its origins to a
      cradle of civilization in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the
      North China Plain. The semi-legendary Xia dynasty in the 21st century BCE
      and the Shang and Zhou dynasties developed a political system to serve
      hereditary monarchies. Written script was developed and inscription of
      Bronze and engraving of Oracle bone became common. Classic literature, and
      the Hundred Schools of Thought emerged during this period and influenced
      the region and beyond for centuries to come. In the third century BCE, the
      Qin dynasty ended the Spring and Autumn and Warring States period when Qin
      Shi Huangdi assumed the self-invented title of Huangdi (Emperor of China).
      Fractured by the uprising peasants, the Qin was replaced by Liu Bang's Han
      dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE). Together they laid the foundation for a
      political tradition of nearly two millennia in which the Chinese empire
      was one of the world's foremost economic powers. The empire expanded,
      fractured, and reunified; absorbed foreign religions and ideas; and made
      world-leading scientific advances, such as the Four Great Inventions:
      gunpowder, paper, the compass, and printing. After centuries of disunity
      following the fall of the Han, the Sui (581–618) and Tang (618–907)
      dynasties reunified the empire. The Tang welcomed foreign trade and
      culture that came over the Silk Road and adapted Buddhism to Chinese
      needs. The early modern Song dynasty (960–1279) became increasingly urban
      and commercial. The civilian scholar-officials or literati adopted the
      examination system and the doctrines of Neo-Confucianism to replace the
      military aristocrats of earlier dynasties. The Mongol established the Yuan
      dynasty in 1279 before the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) re-established Han
      Chinese control. The Manchu-led Qing dynasty nearly doubled the empire's
      territory and established a multi-ethnic state that was the basis of the
      modern Chinese nation, although subsequently suffered heavy losses to
      European imperialism in the 19th century. The Chinese monarchy collapsed
      in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution, when the Republic of China (ROC)
      replaced the imperial ruling of Qing. In its early years, the country
      underwent a rather unstable Warlord Era before mostly centralizing in 1928
      under the Nationalist government. A civil war between the nationalist
      Kuomintang (KMT) and the Chinese
